## Overview
This repository contains ROS 2 packages for simulating and controlling the myCobot robotic arm using ROS 2 Control and MoveIt 2. It provides support for Gazebo simulation and visualization in RViz. Gazebo simulation also includes simulated 3D point cloud data from the depth camera (RGBD) sensor plugin for vision.

## Pick-and-Place Simulation Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b89c3e65-948f-41ce-aadc-c041d993f703

This demo shows a robot arm autonomously performing a pick-and-place task for three color-coded cylinders: yellow, red, and green. The system uses a perception pipeline to detect the cylinders, generate multiple motion plans, and execute the most efficient one for each object.

    Note: The cylinders may appear purple or differently colored in RVIZ. Internally, the logic still distinguishes them correctly using their detected color IDs.
